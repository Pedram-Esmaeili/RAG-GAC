EMR Laboratory Information System Integration

Seamless integration between EMR systems and laboratory information systems (LIS) streamlines the testing process from order entry through result reporting. This integration improves efficiency, reduces errors, and supports timely clinical decision-making based on laboratory findings.

Computerized provider order entry for laboratory tests within the EMR eliminates handwritten requisitions and transcription errors. Orders are transmitted electronically to the laboratory, along with relevant clinical information and specimen collection instructions. The EMR can enforce required fields and provide clinical decision support for appropriate test selection.

Order sets for common scenarios, such as preoperative testing or new diabetes diagnosis, include appropriate laboratory tests along with other orders. These standardized order sets promote evidence-based testing practices and reduce the likelihood of missed tests.

Specimen collection information, including collection time, collector identity, and specimen source, can be documented in the EMR and transmitted to the LIS. Barcode labels generated by the EMR ensure proper specimen identification and link specimens to the correct patient and orders.

Result reporting from the LIS to the EMR should be near real-time, making results available to providers as soon as they are verified by the laboratory. Critical results require special handling, with automated alerts notifying providers about abnormal findings that require immediate attention.

Trend views and graphical displays of laboratory results over time help providers recognize patterns and response to treatments. The EMR should present results in clinically meaningful ways, with reference ranges appropriate for the patient's age, sex, and clinical condition.

Result acknowledgment workflows ensure providers review test results and take appropriate action. The EMR can track which results have been reviewed and send reminders about pending results requiring follow-up.

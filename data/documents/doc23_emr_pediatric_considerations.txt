Pediatric EMR Considerations

Pediatric care presents unique challenges for EMR systems that are often designed primarily for adult populations. Specialized functionality is necessary to support safe and effective care for children from birth through adolescence.

Growth and development tracking is essential in pediatrics. EMRs should automatically calculate and plot growth parameters on standardized growth charts, flagging abnormal patterns that might indicate underlying health problems. Developmental milestone tracking supports early identification of developmental delays.

Weight-based medication dosing requires robust clinical decision support. Pediatric medication orders must account for patient weight, with automatic dose calculations and alerts for doses outside safe ranges. Maximum dose limits prevent dangerous overdoses, even when per-kilogram dosing would suggest higher amounts.

Immunization management in pediatric EMRs includes decision support for complex schedules that vary based on age, prior vaccines, and catch-up scenarios. Integration with immunization registries ensures accurate records across healthcare settings and supports population-level vaccination tracking.

Adolescent confidentiality presents unique EMR challenges. Teen patients may require certain information to be protected from parental access while still supporting appropriate parental involvement. EMRs should allow nuanced privacy controls that comply with regulations regarding adolescent consent and confidentiality.

Age-specific reference ranges for laboratory values, vital signs, and other parameters must be incorporated into EMRs to avoid inappropriate alerting. Normal values in children often differ substantially from adult norms and change with age.

Family-centered care documentation acknowledges that pediatric care involves the family unit. EMRs should support documentation of family medical history, psychosocial factors, and family involvement in care planning and decision-making.
